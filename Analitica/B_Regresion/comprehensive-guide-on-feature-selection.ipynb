    "- Random forests are one the most popular machine learning algorithms. They are so successful because they provide in general a good predictive performance, low overfitting and easy interpretability. This interpretability is given by the fact that it is straightforward to derive the importance of each variable on the tree decision. In other words, it is easy to compute how much each variable is contributing to the decision.\n",

    "- Random forests consist of 4-12 hundred decision trees, each of them built over a random extraction of the observations from the dataset and a random extraction of the features. Not every tree sees all the features or all the observations, and this guarantees that the trees are de-correlated and therefore less prone to over-fitting. Each tree is also a sequence of yes-no questions based on a single or combination of features. At each node (this is at each question), the three divides the dataset into 2 buckets, each of them hosting observations that are more similar among themselves and different from the ones in the other bucket. Therefore, the importance of each feature is derived by how \"pure\" each of the buckets is.\n",

Therefore, when training a tree, it is possible to compute how much each feature decreases the impurity. The more a feature decreases the impurity, the more important the feature is. In random forests, the impurity decrease from each feature can be averaged across trees to determine the final importance of the variable.\n",
